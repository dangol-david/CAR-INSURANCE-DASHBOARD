## Claims history data

Customer demographic data (age, gender, education)

Vehicle details (type, year, mileage)

### 📊 Dashboard Components & Insights
1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
🔹 Total Policies: 10,000 (showing the portfolio size)
🔹 Claims Rate: 31% (percentage of policies with claims)
🔹 High-Risk Drivers: 3.96% (identifies riskiest policyholders)
🔹 Average Annual Mileage: 11,710 miles (mileage impacts claim likelihood)

2. Demographic Analysis
🔹 Claims by Gender:

42.16% (one gender segment)

57.84% (another gender segment)
(Helps in gender-based risk assessment & pricing adjustments)

🔹 Claims by Age Group:

0-9y, 10-19y, 20-29y, 30y+
(Younger drivers may have higher claims, affecting premiums)

🔹 Claims by Education: (Correlates education level with claim frequency)

3. Vehicle & Driving Behavior Insights
🔹 Vehicle Type:

Sedan vs. Sports Car (Sports cars may have higher claims)

Before 2015 vs. After 2015 (Older cars might have more claims)

🔹 Annual Mileage Impact:

Histogram showing claims across mileage brackets
(Higher mileage = Higher risk of accidents → Adjust premiums accordingly)

🔹 Driving Risk Classification:

High Risk (3.96%) → Need stricter underwriting

Moderate Risk → Standard policies

Low Risk → Eligible for discounts

### 🔍 Key Insights & Business Impact
✔ High-Risk Drivers (3.96%) contribute disproportionately to claims → Increase premiums or impose restrictions
✔ Sports cars & older vehicles may need higher insurance costs
✔ Young drivers (20-29y) could have more claims → Adjust pricing models
✔ Higher mileage = More claims → Usage-based insurance (UBI) models could help
